# Contributing to Lee School

There are essentially 3 ways to contribute:

1. [Add new content](https://github.com/t7leeschool/t7leeschool.github.io/new/master#add-new-content)
2. [Report wrong information](https://github.com/t7leeschool/t7leeschool.github.io/new/master#report-wrong-information)
3. [Discuss changes that other people suggest](https://github.com/t7leeschool/t7leeschool.github.io/new/master#discuss-changes-that-other-people-suggest)

## Add new content

1. Go to the `_pages` directory present [here](https://github.com/t7leeschool/t7leeschool.github.io/tree/master/_pages) and open the section where you want to add a new change. You can even create a new section by creating a new file of the extension `.md`.

And you are done! Wait for people to comment on your changes and eventual-Lee incorporate your changes :)

## Report wrong information

1. Open a new isse [here](https://github.com/t7leeschool/t7leeschool.github.io/issues/new) and describe what you see wrong.

That is it. Your issue will be discussed and eventually corrected.

## Discuss changes that other people suggest

You can have a look at the open [pull requests](https://github.com/t7leeschool/t7leeschool.github.io/pulls) and [issues](https://github.com/t7leeschool/t7leeschool.github.io/issues) and vouch in the conversation there. Treat it like an internet forum.
