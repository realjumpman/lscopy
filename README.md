The Lee Discord brings you Tekken 7 Lee Chaolan gameplay content in an easy to digest format with this website. Anyone can contribute to this website by editing the content directly on Github and every change will be tracked and discussed with the power of Git and Github.

## How do I use this?

Go to https://t7leeschool.github.io/

## How to suggest a change?

Read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). It's really simple.

## I see some wrong information. How do I tell you about it?

Open an new issue by [clicking here](https://github.com/t7leeschool/t7leeschool.github.io/issues/new) and describe what you find wrong. 

### Why did we make this?

Discord is inadequate in terms of information organisation and crowd-sourced information. Github is much better at it.
