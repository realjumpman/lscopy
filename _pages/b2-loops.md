title: b2 loops
---

Almost every staple combo uses b2 loops. You don't need to master them before
playing Lee.

Combos with b2 loops do at most 6 more damage, and they have slightly better
wall carry. It's far from the most pressing thing to optimize. It may as well
be the last thing to optimize.

In isolation, b2 loops are not that hard. The window is 3 frames. It's not
strict. The hard part is never dropping it.

Because the extra damage from a b2 loop is so small, it's not sensible---if
your goal is only to win the current game---to attempt a loop until your hit
rate is over 95%.

How do you get to this point? You might think the only way is to grind out
hour long practise sessions. This will of course work, but do you really want
to do that?

If you want a life outside of practising b2 loops, the answer is simple:
practise while waiting for opponents. Try them in actual games occasionally.
Don't force it.

You'll lose a lot of games to dropped b2 loops. It's unavoidable.

Then, one day, it'll all come together. This can take months, even years.

b2 loops are a commitment to Lee. It's a decision you make after playing
him for a while, when the pain of dropped b2's can't phase you, when you're
ready to say with confidence that you're a Lee player.
