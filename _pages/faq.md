## b+2,f\~N ws2,4

b, N, 2, 4\\
Note the neutral: b must be released before pressing 2

## CH d+3,4 b+3,3,f\~N

Hold b, then press 3 exactly when Lee starts the "come on" motion with his hands

## Mist Trap

## Hopkick (u/f+4) from crouch

For block punish, u/f+4 in the blockstun (complete the input in the buffer period to avoid getting the backflips)\\
For whiff punish, u\~u/f+4 (crouch cancel)

## f,F+3 after ws2,3

First f in the buffer period\\
Second f one frame before the 3, timed exactly with the recovery ending

## f+2,1 finisher after S! with 7 aerial attacks
## b+4 finisher after S! with 5 aerial attacks
## Micro dash for b+3,3,f\~N pickups

f, F in the buffer period - don't mash

## HMS cancel

D,d/b,b\\
D/F,b\\
Hold the first input during the transition, then do the rest exactly as the transition finishes

<summary markdown="0">Fast HMS u/f+3</summary>
In the buffer period of an HMS transition:

- If you input u before u/f or 3, then HMS sidestep gets buffered
- If you input u/f before 3, then forward jump gets buffered
- If you input 3 before u/f, then HMS 3 gets buffered

In other words, you must input u/f and 3 on the same frame to buffer it.

The other option is to time the input perfectly. In this case, you input U/F in the buffer and press 3 when the transition finishes. You'll get a forward jump only if the 3 is pressed extremely late.

3+4 takes 10 frames, so from neutral the fastest you can do HMS u/f+3 is 30 frames.

## b+1:1, f\~N after b+2, f\~N in juggles

(extremely hard even with practice, not staple)
