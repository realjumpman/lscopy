<summary markdown="0">How to lab sidestepping</summary>
1. Go to practice mode with p2 set to the character you want to lab
2. Select "Repeat action" from CPU action
3. Record 1 jab into whatever move you want to test
4. Play the recording, and try to step after the jab

If you want to test extensively, replace the jab with something else. Moves
can be harder or easier to step depending on the frame advantage, distance,
and even angle. In some weird cases, such as Lee's 1 jab, the tracking of the next
move can change a lot because it rotates his body to the right slightly.
