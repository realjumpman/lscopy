Yoshi's basic tools have been buffed in this game\\
but they're still kinda garbage\\
he thrives off of oki and mixups\\
while a lot of his block or stance transitions have a multi-option mind game\\
that are mostly pretty meh reward if they hit\\
unless were talking about flash setups for ex\\
yoshi can be out spaced pretty easily\\
his upclose tools aren't very good either\\
there's not much to fear at any point\\
his fc game is meh until you're at an oki situation\\
50/50\\
FC df+4 is launchable on block\\
sword sweep can be outspaced, Lee has a hard time punishing wiffed sweeps\\
it has longer recovery on wiff than it looks though\\
3~4 block situation is really important to know\\
on block most bad yoshis like to go for DGF 2 launcher\\
it's +4 on block, high and his fastest option out of DGF\\
trades with i12 moves iirc\\
you can jab yoshi out of DGF for a combo every time(edited)\\
anything else too slow for him to commit to\\
but the mind game starts\\
so if you auto jab\\
he can do 3~4 in to duck, hopkick\\
or with NSS duck, Flash\\
(did they give yoshi flash from fc in this game in 1SS? If yes, even in 1SS)(edited)\\
3~4 can be walked, but it tracks steps well\\
has good range\\
and some mind games\\
on hit you can't interrupt DGF\\
ff+4 on block\\
mind game with yoshi either holding b or db\\
-6 iirc\\
Yoshi turns back with db, he gets hit with df+1\\
but can block with b for i13 mids iirc\\
or I might be wrong and df+1 covers both situations\\
but he can always evade most tracking i13 mids with BT b+3_4\\
this creates a multi option mind game again\\
and he can possibly launch your wiff if you wiff a slower mid\\
if the yoshi does the b+3_4 cancel in to some move(edited)\\
KIN 1+2\\
again BT situation\\
this time df+1 beats everything they can possibly do except sidespin\\
bad yoshis usually think you'll respect it and mash BT low sweep or some dumb shit\\
df+1 or go for a hard read depending on your opponent\\
okay so those 3 block situations\\
are really important to know\\
and deal with\\
they're getting free mixups\\
yoshis love getting free mixups\\
they're all about conditioning their opponent\\
so he's good in long sets\\
but will test how ignorant their opp is to the match up\\
because if you take mixups out of the question\\
you leave yoshi with his basic tools\\
his basic tools are garbage\\
df+1 is linear, df+4 is linear\\
df+1,4 his new i13 punisher\\
2nd hit sometimes wiffs\\
and you get a launch\\
it's also -14 on block\\
df+1 is linear, df+4 is linear\\
df+1,4 his new i13 punisher\\
2nd hit sometimes wiffs\\
and you get a launch\\
it's also -14 on block\\
d+2,2 (-14)\\
d+2,2,1 and d+2,2,d+1\\
d+2,2,1 last hit high\\
d+2,2,d+1 -10 on block, mid\\
iirc you can just fuzzy it\\
but pretty low reward string to go for\\
d+2,2 has good range though, i16\\
but -14 on block\\
the mind game becomes after they bait you to punish d+2,2\\
they end it\\
df+1+2,2 his only damaging standing low\\
Used to be launch on block, now -13\\
It's as slow as a snake edge but due to animation hard to react to\\
i26\\
and for some reason it tracks steps in this game iirc\\
fucking namco hitboxes\\
0 on hit\\
uhh\\
low hitbox knee low in to backswing mid\\
NH\\
43 damage low\\
df+1+2 by itself is -11\\
db+3,3 is one of the only tracking lows he has\\
but it's ass on hit -7 and -19 on block, hard to punish due to followups\\
yeah I guess two of his best lows\\
and the NSS fc df+3\\
his oldschool FC df+4\\
launching fc low\\
launch on block obviously\\
but has good range\\
but the thing with yoshis fc lows now is\\
he has the ws string launcher now\\
ws 2,1\\
same move used to be m,h with no launch\\
yeah way better\\
so the opponent is more likely to just hold those lows\\
but gotta remember all of them are super risky\\
he's only getting by because he's conditioning the opponent\\
--> mindless tech --> sword sweep\\
vs Yoshi df+1,2 launcher, Lee can go under it on block with d+2_b+3+4 (PC)_d+3 and Punch Parry (b+1+2) in to mixup(edited)\\
vs DGF\\
DGF+2 is a high launcher and is +4~+5 on block\\
DGF+4 is a safe mid. Though not a homing, it has very excellent tracking, -6 on block it also launches on CH.\\
DGF+3 is a quick low, -14 on block and launches on CH.\\
DGF+3+4 is a throw.\\
DGF+1 is a mid unblockable slash 0 on hit
