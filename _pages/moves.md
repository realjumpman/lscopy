- Has big pushback. Useful to see how they handle playing at range.
- On block, d/f+4,3 1,f~N over and over
  - See if you catch a duck with it
  - If you do, then they either know that Sway 4 exists or they don't know how to deal with the range it leaves you at
  - You can MS 3,4 or f,F+3 them if they whiff
- It's like doing 3,4 HMS cancel over and over
- But better since you're creating a huge amount of space first, letting you MS in

## 1,2,f\~N

- Good way to know if your opp knows the Lee match up
- Most follow ups lose to SWL
- If the opp doesn't do that, you get fake pressure for free
