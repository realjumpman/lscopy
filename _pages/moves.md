## Useful HMS transitions

<details>
<summary markdown="0">b+4,3</summary>

- With the HMS cancel, b+4 becomes -2~-0 on block, +8~+10 on hit along with the properties of b+4
- The best keepout tool that Lee has. Larger than normal vertical hitbox and a forward range is generous.
  - Notorious tracking to both sides if the 3 is delayed (effectively a b+4>3), to the extent that it is now called as 'pseudo-homing' because it almost acts as a homing move.
  - The HMS cancel puts Lee far back from the hitbox which makes whiff punishing this move harder for the opponent.
  - HMS 2 follow up goes under most highs with a restricted vertical hitbox e.g. Jabs.
  - HMS 3 powercrush follow up catches anything slower than a jab. i10 moves (like jabs) will get consumed by the power crush and allow the opponent to duck under HMS 3.
  - Use as a keepout tool mainly. However, it can be used to imply a frame data mind game on block at close range.
  - On counter hit, pickup with HMS~f, ws 2,3 into the rest of the staple combo.
- Cancelling into stand guard from b+4,3 should be practiced by inputting d,db,b (quarter circle back motion) during the recovery of b+4,3 i.e. as soon as Lee lands his right foot on the ground. Cancelling saves you from being locked in HMS, and saves you from unwarranted whiff punishes from the opponent.
  - The cancel into stand guard can be limited to only d,db to enter FC directly from HMS and imply a FC mixup if needed.
- Moves out of the HMS can be used to consume the opponent's tries to whiff punish your out-of-range b4 whiffs.
- Should not be abused against characters with long range whiff punishment.

<summary markdown="0">f,f,F+3,4,3</summary>

- +6 on block, KND on hit
- Lee's running move that gives free plus frames with second hit, floor break with second hit, wall break with first hit.
- Use it to close distances from range 1+ and gain plus frames on the side.
  - Doing the f,f,F motion does telegraph your f,f,F+3,4,3 attempt if done from afar
  - Opponents can side step this move easily on reaction to your telegraph.
  - Practice instant while running motion to force proper use.
- Ends in HMS and on block provides an uninterruptible HMS 1+2 attempt if done as soon as HMS transition recovers.
  - Lili and Alisa can side-step-left HMS 1+2.
- All moves slower than i15 are uninterruptible on block.
- On hit opponent goes in a backrollable spike animation
  - If the opponent does not backroll out of the spike (by not holding B), then Lee gets a free HMS uf+4 on-the-ground hit.
- Can be performed with usual instant while running motion techniques.
- Gives free combo on hit on floor-break stages starting with aerial hit 2 because the second hit breaks floors on aerial hit.
  - Use at wall splats/tailspins when near the wall to break the floor to get a high wallsplat combo after.

<summary markdown="0">b+1:1,3+4</summary>

- Starts at i15, -1 on block, +10 on hit and counter hit.
- The non-hms transition version (b+1:1) is -5 on block, +6 on hit and counter hit
- Best used as a hit confirmable string with b+1:1,2 being the hit confirm and b+1:1,3+4 being the recovery in hms for handling retaliations.
- Recovering at -1 in HMS on block means that HMS 1 will trade with i13 retaliations.
  - However, the pushback on this transition is the main attraction here.
  - The pushback makes it difficult for the opponent to impose retaliation and can cause then to whiff fast responses like jabs and df+1 mids.
- Being -1 also helps in securing Lee from most high and mid retaliations with HMS 3 (jabs will get power crushed, however still allowing the opponent to duck under HMS 3 upon recovery). Any retaliation slower than i10 will get powercrushed and activate the HMS 3 attack throw animation for 20 damage.
  - HMS 3 being homing, aerial screw and a power crush helps this transition be a good pressure tool when the opponent has their back at the wall. Most Lee players will use either b+1:1,3+4 or his other homing moves to keep walled opponents in check.
- b+1:1 tracks to Lee's right with the just frame and the second hit also tracks (regardless of the just frame) to Lee's right, which catches the opponent trying to side step to their left (Lee's weak side). Well used as a tool to discourage SSL.
- Opponents will usually duck when they see b+1:1 to duck the next hit in the string (b+1:1,2). There are mind games opportunities here based on whether you complete the string or choose to utilize the pressure.
- Added advantage with an optional transition into MS with b+1:1,f~N makes Lee -5 on block and +1 on hit and counter hit. This further sets up mind games when combined with movement and hard reads on the opponent's retaliations.

## d/f+4

<!-- https://discordapp.com/channels/361852916203651074/459202763159633933/459203002427899924 -->

- Has big pushback. Useful to see how they handle playing at range.
- On block, d/f+4,3 1,f~N over and over
  - See if you catch a duck with it
  - If you do, then they either know that Sway 4 exists or they don't know how to deal with the range it leaves you at
  - You can MS 3,4 or f,F+3 them if they whiff
- It's like doing 3,4 HMS cancel over and over
- But better since you're creating a huge amount of space first, letting you MS in

## 1,2,f\~N

<!-- https://discordapp.com/channels/361852916203651074/362318093097107458/442468808750268417 -->

- Good way to know if your opp knows the Lee match up
- Most follow ups lose to SWL
- If the opp doesn't do that, you get fake pressure for free
