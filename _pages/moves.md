## Useful HMS transitions

## b+4,3

- With the HMS cancel, b+4 becomes -2~-0 on block, +8~+10 on hit along with the properties of b+4
- The best keepout tool that Lee has. Larger than normal vertical hitbox and a forward range is generous.
  - Notorious tracking to both sides if the 3 is delayed (effectively a b+4>3), to the extent that it is now called as 'pseudo-homing' because it almost acts as a homing move.
  - The HMS cancel puts Lee far back from the hitbox which makes whiff punishing this move harder for the opponent.
  - HMS 2 follow up goes under most highs with a restricted vertical hitbox e.g. Jabs.
  - HMS 3 powercrush follow up catches anything slower than a jab. i10 moves (like jabs) will get consumed by the power crush and allow the opponent to duck under HMS 3.
  - Use as a keepout tool mainly. However, it can be used to imply a frame data mind game on block at close range.
  - On counter hit, pickup with HMS~f, ws 2,3 into the rest of the staple combo.
- Cancelling into stand guard from b+4,3 should be practiced by inputting d,db,b (quarter circle back motion) during the recovery of b+4,3 i.e. as soon as Lee lands his right foot on the ground. Cancelling saves you from being locked in HMS, and saves you from unwarranted whiff punishes from the opponent.
  - The cancel into stand guard can be limited to only d,db to enter FC directly from HMS and imply a FC mixup if needed.
- Moves out of the HMS can be used to consume the opponent's tries to whiff punish your out-of-range b4 whiffs.
- Should not be abused against characters with long range whiff punishment.

## d/f+4

- Has big pushback. Useful to see how they handle playing at range.
- On block, d/f+4,3 1,f~N over and over
  - See if you catch a duck with it
  - If you do, then they either know that Sway 4 exists or they don't know how to deal with the range it leaves you at
  - You can MS 3,4 or f,F+3 them if they whiff
- It's like doing 3,4 HMS cancel over and over
- But better since you're creating a huge amount of space first, letting you MS in

## 1,2,f\~N

- Good way to know if your opp knows the Lee match up
- Most follow ups lose to SWL
- If the opp doesn't do that, you get fake pressure for free
