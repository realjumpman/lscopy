[We could and should have very detailed notes for all key moves. I've implemented a dropdown thingy on <https://cthor.me/Lee-movelist> that enables adding notes with a video to the moves, but it'd take a long time to add notes to everything. I'm also not really an authority on the character, so notes by more experienced players would be better. Comment links like the above should work fine for linking to previous discussion.]
