### Combos

- f+4,1 does 2 less damage than ws2,4 @ max scaling (30%)
- f+4,1 carries slightly further than ws2,4
- f+4,1 hits off axis where ws2,4 wouldn't
- f+4,1 hits faster and further than ws2,4
- d+4,4,u+3,f\~N can pick up in some cases where b+3,3,f\~N can't, such as late contact spring kick
- off axis launch 4,u+3,f\~N, f+4,1 S! b+2,f\~N(x2) f+2,1
  - second b2 sometimes not possible at bad angle
  - need deep mist step to connect f+4,1 (delay it)
- new max carry with f+4,1, difficult and quite inconsistent:
  - on axis launch SSR 4,u+3 b+2,f\~N(x4) f+4,1 S! f+2,1
  - need deep mist step to connect f+4,1 (delay it)
  - b+2,f\~N(x4) f+4,1 S! f+2,1 works without any sidestep in these combos:
    - HMS2 4,u+3
    - ws2,3 d/f+3+4,f\~N S! d+2
    - CH Sway 4 d2(x2)
    - CH HMS 4 ws2,3
