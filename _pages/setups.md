d/b+3 spikes, so they can't tech roll when it's used as a finisher.

If you do b+2,f\~N d/b+3 as aerial hits 6--7, you get a really good oki
situation from mid stage or infinite stage maps:

- d,D/B+4 will hit grounded or wake up kicks
- d/b+3+4 will hit side roll left
- d+3 after a delay will hit both rolls
- FC d/f+4 and HMS 4 will hit both rolls

The spacing makes everything but HMS 4 safe on block vs most characters.
