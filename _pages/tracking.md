## Important results
- 444 is pretty useless (everyone knows that) except for after wr34, since all 3 hits will be blocked except he backdashes, but honestly you can use your + frames better. it trackes everything in this scenario.
- ff4 is good at catching people stepping/walking to the left a lot and can become very hard to step when delayed.
- ff3 has practically no tracking, but just like ff4 becomes hard to step when delayed.

After df1 (-1):
- 3 tracks very well only losing to swl.
- db3+4 has very bad tracking only beating ssr.
- f2 is a good tool to catch opponents who try to ssr/swr after df1. especially usefull at the wall when they cant ssl.
- db3 is good for catching stepper but not walkers. if you have to go low d3 will always hit.
- dont use f4 for ch f43 fishing. it will lose to everything except ssr and only when you do the extension. doing df1, 1, f4 is a better sequence.
- A lot of moves lose to swl here, your only good option is 12, d3, d4, ff4 or full homing to catch swl if you really want to press. df2 is a bit weird tracking wise, but sometimes is full homing to ssl/swl.

After 1 (+1) many moves get enhanced tracking:
- df1 is practically homing
- db3 is practically homing
- db3+4 has very good tracking only losing to swl
- df2 starts tracking ssl/swl
- f4 gains ssl/swl tracking making it better to fish for ch f43, good for conditioning people who want to step for df1, tho it is already homing in this scenario.
- f2 gains enhanced tracking only losing to swl. good at walls if you opponent wants to move.

After db3(+2) A lot of moves start whiffing so be cautious and observe your opponent:
- df2 is useless here. the pushback will make it always whiff.
- df1 for catching ssr/swr and df4 to catch ssl/swl here
- 3 is very bad here if you opponents like to step. it has no tracking at all. good for interuppting if they want to intterupt with a df1.
- db3 gains good tracking here only losing to swl, but the pushback from the previous one makes it risky to use. against backdashing opponents.
- db3+4 same tracking as db3, but wont whiff on a backdashing opponent.
- db4 doesnt fully track at +2- it becomes weak to ssl/swl here.

After wr34 (+3):
- df1 tracks as normal ssr/swr, but df4 now also catches ssr only losing to swr.
- 3 gains better tracking only losing to swl.
- db3 and db3+4 only lose to swl here.
- 4 is here a good option to catch ssl as a lot of moves are weak to it at these frames and 44 also catches ssr, only losing to swr.

After db3+4 (+4) a lot of moves becomes almost impossible to step:
- 3 is only beaten by a fast swl, meaning 3 into a confirm for 33 is possible to using the +1 frames to pressure. db3, df1 should be homing here again. or you can just use 3 and are +8.
- 44 has weird tracking here it sometimes is fully homing and sometimes only tracks ssl/swl.
- df4, 12, d3, d4, db4, f4 are fully tracking.
i would just recommend going over the stuff after important stuff
i think a lot is already known, but just did it anyways
